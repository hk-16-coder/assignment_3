Task - 1:
This programn  computes factorial of an integer n.
Logic used here is recursion .
A base case is first stated and function calls itself again and again .
Time complexity of this method is O(n).
And the program finally displays the computed factorial value to the user.

Task - 2:
This program uses in-built math library of python , using the function math.sqrt(),math.log(),math.sin() to calculate the respective.
firstly it takes a number as an input from the user and calculates the following and displays it to the user.
Time complexity is O(1).
